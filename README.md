# Econometric Analysis of Time-Series Data

## Description

This group project performs an econometric analysis of time-series data for a sample dataset. The aim is to learn how to inspect time-series data for stationarity and to provide two examples how non-stationary time-series can be transformed into stationary ones, which is necessary in econometrics before being able to make any meaningful statistical inferences.

The project includes the following statistical analyses:
* Visual inspection of time-series data
* ACF/PACF plots
* Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests
* ARMA(p,q) model selection with AIC and BIC
* Coefficient tests
* Ljung-Box test
* Likelihood ratio tests

The code is well commented as my aim was that anyone who finds my code on GitHub would be able to understand, modify and use it. It is split into a lot of sections which can be collapsed. Experience R coders can therefore easily skip sections that are not relevant for them.

The project covers many of the skills taught in class such as loading data, modifying it, visualizing data, fitting statistical models and many more. However, in many parts, the project goes far beyond what was taught in class. Especially, this project requires solid pre-existing knowledge in econometrics and time-series analysis. If you want to brush up you knowledge in any of these areas, please consult the material in the references section. Or, if you're lazy, have a quick into Ben Lambert's introduction to ARMA(1,1) models video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg0RnP1uLVc

## How to run the code

Running the code is very simple. Just perform the following steps:
1) Download the "Econometric Analysis of Time-Series Data.R" file to the desired destination on your computer
2) Download the "Data.csv" file to the desired destination on your computer
3) Open the "Econometric Analysis of Time-Series Data.R" and just start running the code, no adjustment to any line of code should be needed
